Bayesian Media Mix Model to analyze the impact of advertising campaigns on sales and ROI.

This project implements a **Bayesian Media Mix Model (BMMM)** to quantify the impact of marketing campaigns on product sales across multiple channels. Using historical advertising spend and sales data, the model estimates channel-level contribution, campaign effectiveness, and ROI while accounting for lagged effects and uncertainty in the estimates. 

The project is designed as a **hands-on guide for marketers and data scientists** to understand Bayesian approaches to media mix modeling, adstock effects, and data-driven campaign optimization.
